This folder contains the scripts for dissolution simulations.

The folder "python/setup" contains three files:
- makeSystem.py: contain functions for building up the setup
- dissolution.py: contian functions to find number of neighbors and remove voxles
- convenience.py: set color, convert to boolean, and define empty matrixes

The folder "runScripts" contains two files:
- dissolution_buildSystem.py: Build a system from scratch and dissolves it
- dissolution_dataFiles.py: Import a .raw file and dissolve it

The folder "analyse" contains two files:
- plot_removedVoxels.py: An example on how to plot the number of removed voxels after each iteration
- makeDistanceMaps.py: An example on how to make distance maps from the generated binary files

To run the disslution-script, a path to the setup-folder must be provided.

Requirements:
- numpy
- matplotlib
